/**
 * The purpose of a Service class is to contain "business logic" that sits between the web layer (controller) and
 * persistence layer (DAO). That means that the Service class performs tasks that aren't done through the web or
 * SQL: programming tasks like checking that the input is valid, conducting additional security checks, or saving the
 * actions undertaken by the API to a logging file.
 *
 * It's perfectly normal to have Service methods that only contain a single line that calls a DAO method. An
 * application that follows best practices will often have unnecessary code, but this makes the code more
 * readable and maintainable in the long run!
